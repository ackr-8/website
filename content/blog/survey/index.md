**Survey link:** [https://survey.mcaptcha.org/survey/campaigns/b717e51e-24d4-4ab6-912f-de2dfe3ce1fe/about](https://survey.mcaptcha.org/survey/campaigns/b717e51e-24d4-4ab6-912f-de2dfe3ce1fe/about)

mCaptcha relies on a
[proof-of-work(PoW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work)
mechanism to guard against bots. In order for this to be effective, the
difficulty factor should be configured properly. If the difficulty
factor is too high all the time, it will inconvenience the users and if
it's too low during attack, the defence will be weak.

So we are conducting a survey to gather performance benchmarks from
various devices and browsers. The data collected from the survey will be made
public, we believe it will guide sysadmins configure difficulty factor
properly.

If you are interested in the lucky draw, please save the `submission ID` and the `proof` will be presented
to you at the end of the survey.

mCaptcha is a kickass CAPTCHA systems that gives (DDoS)
attackers a run for their money. And we do all of this without tracking
your users. Oh and did I mention our UX is great?

At mCaptcha, we believe in digital freedom and privacy and so we built
an proof-of-work based CAPTCHA system that doesn’t track. Seriously, no
tracking. But that isn’t the killer feature, our system doesn’t require
the user to pick cars or ID sidewalks — our system does it’s
thing(usually at the click of a button) and gets out of the way. Our
Philosophy

## Philosophy

Man has has come so far only because our ancestors chose to share their
knowledge with others. If everything was labeled intellectual property,
we might still be stuck in Stone Age. The idea of intellectual property
is alien to us. For this reason, all of our source code is freely
available(both as in freedom and beers) at our [GitHub](https://github.com/mCaptcha).
